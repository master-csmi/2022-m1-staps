## Objectives of the projet: 

 The objective of this work is to identify practitioner profiles based on positive or negative qualifiers, i.e., to assign a profile to each cluster in the data and to estimate the strength of these profiles, i.e., the number of clusters or profiles that are most representative of the data.

## Organisation 
The data Analysis and Classification folders contain 2 files: a file that creates python functions and methods and a test file that uses its functions to answer our problem.we find all our data in the file, the project report in reports.
The clustering file shows the codes used in R for the clustering part of the project.
Our test files allow us to reproduce the results obtained in the project.
